# Document classifier

## Summary
This AI method would identify document types at a workplace and would create metadata. Based on the metadata the documents would be sorted in different chategories and would be managed according to document management rules set up for the doc type.

## Background
At my workplace business expert are receiveing and creating many (meaining: huuuge amount) documents. These documents should be managed, stored and archived based on their document type. These document types are easy to identify based on the title and templates they are using. The AI method could use Natural Language processing (NLP).
The problem this would solve a few issues regarding Document classification and sorting. What it wouldn't solve is information flow problems. It would only help if the critical documents are reaching the dedicated repository.

## How is it used?
Whenever a new document would be uploaded to a sharepoint site it would create a new column of metadata with document types. This could be a basis for further workflows and rules.

## Data source and AI methods
Internally at my workplace, historical data is available. The "bag of words" method can be applied with Natural Language Processing. It would be applied to the document title then the content.

## Challanges
The biggest challange is to create the proper document type list and train the AI properly.

## What next?
I need my coworkers support first, then involve my IT team for support. Later we could implement the method to other departments too.
